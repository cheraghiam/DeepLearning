# Data Processing to Deep Learning Roadmap 🚀

**Welcome!** This repository is a structured, step-by-step learning path that takes you from **data processing** all the way to **deep learning**. It is designed for students, developers, and AI enthusiasts who want a complete, practical roadmap.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Master **data processing** with NumPy, Pandas, and Polars.
* Perform **data analysis and visualization** with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.
* Learn **machine learning** concepts and algorithms (supervised & unsupervised).
* Dive into **deep learning** using PyTorch: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs.
* Explore **advanced AI topics** like Transformers, RL, and AI agents.
* Build **mini-projects** at each stage to reinforce learning.
